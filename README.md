# Sign-Language-Recognition-Project
In this sign language recognition project, we create a sign detector, which detects numbers from 1 to 10 that can very easily be extended to cover a vast multitude of other signs and hand gestures including the alphabets.


Steps to develop sign language recognition project
This is divided into 3 parts:

#Creating the dataset
#Training a CNN on the captured dataset
#Predicting the data

Summary
We have successfully developed sign language detection project. This is an interesting machine learning python project to gain expertise. 
This can be further extended for detecting the English alphabets.
